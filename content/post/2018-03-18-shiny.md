Yesterday I tried making an application in Shiny for interactive data visualization. This app shows the proportion of accidents in the city of Baton Rouge, LA with respect to a certain factor, such as road condition or lighting. The data for this application was takeng from publicly avaliable repository ([link](https://data.brla.gov/Transportation-and-Infrastructure/Baton-Rouge-Traffic-Incidents/2tu5-7kif)). 
This version is pretty bare-bones, but I plan on adding more features, such as real-time k-means clustering, in the future. An important caveat is that although this database is updated daily, as specified on the site, I used the static version (since I lack a direct link to the database) downloaded on March 17, 2018. You can see the app in action [here](https://agleontyev.shinyapps.io/my_first_shiny/), and the code below. Since markdown has troubles displaying Russian characters, this code only has English titles.
```

          library(lattice)
          cars_br <- read.csv(file="Baton_Rouge_Traffic_Incidents.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
          cars_names <- names(cars_br)
          allowed_names <- cars_names[c(13, 21:33)]
          library(shiny)




          # Define UI for application that draws a histogram
          ui <- fluidPage(

              # Application title
          titlePanel("Accidents in Baton Rouge, LA"),

              # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
          sidebarLayout(
            sidebarPanel(
              selectInput('xcol', 'Factor', allowed_names),
              hr(),
              helpText("Frequency of accidents in Baton Rouge depending on the factor. Choose the factor above and see the proportion of accidents associated with it.")
              ),

            # Show a plot of the generated distribution
            mainPanel(
               plotOutput("distPlot")
            )
          )
          )



          # Define server logic required to draw a histogram
          server <- function(input, output) {

              output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
            # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
           selectedData <- reactive({
             cars_br[, input$xcol]
           })

           x    <- selectedData()
           # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins

           dotplot(summary(x)/length(x), col = rgb(0.2,0.2,0.8,0.7), main = "Proportion of Accidents", lwd = 10, pch = 17, cex =3.0, scales=list(cex=1.3), xlab = "Proportion")
          })
          }

          # Run the application 
          shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
