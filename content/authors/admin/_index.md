I am a scientist interested in applying machine learning, statistics and data visualization techniques to answer political, psychological and economic questions. 

In my work I use Python (sklearn, matplotlib, Scipy, pandas and other libraries) and R (Caret, MASS, tidyverse family, ggplot and other libraries). I am also skilled with SPSS and other statistical packages, such as Jamovi and JASP.
